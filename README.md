## User Story

When the user arrives on the Book Buddy application, they will see a header, brief introduction, and a dropdown menu of genres to select from. When the user selects a genre from the dropdown and clicks "Go!", a selection of books matching their selected genre will populate after a bit of loading time.

Each search result is contained on its own card and includes a cover of the book, the title, the first sentence, the number of page, and a button linking the user to an Amazon link to purchase.

If the user would like, there is a second filter option available. This second filter allows the user to choose a maximum number of pages for their selected genre. This way, the user can further limit their search results, making it easier to select their desired read.

## Description

This book finder was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bulma.

As a book lovers, we wanted to create a simple, easy to navigate way to discover new books. The search results provide title, number of pages, the first sentence of the book, cover art, and a link to buy, making it the ideal tool to use when we want to quickly discover a new read.

As a book lover, I want to go to my Book Buddy application, select a preferred book genre, filter by number of pages, and see the titles of several books matching my filter criteria. Upon receiving my results, I want to easily be able to purchase one of my search results via an Amazon link.
